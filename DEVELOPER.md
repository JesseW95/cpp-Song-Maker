**Design Decisions:**
	
	**File Reader**
	I decided to make a file input for reading song notes, this made it easier to test and is documented in the code
	on how to use it.
	
	**Vector Usage**
	I found this to be the most effective way to iterate through a large collection of sound samples to output to a file.
